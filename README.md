# ZenMode
 15-112 Term Project

# Description: 
ZenMode is a game where users must maintain or reach “zen”. Users will be asked to fill out a quiz at the start of the game(to gauge how they feel) (this information will be used to determine how the game plays). If the user feels more “happy” or positive their goal is to maintain this zen, that means collecting words that are synonyms for how they feel. If users feel more negative their goal is to regain their zen, that means collecting antonyms of how they feel and avoiding synonyms. Words will fall from top of screen to bottom and player must try and collect them before they hit the ground
